# Multi-Robot Graph SLAM using LIDAR Simulation Package

This repository contains a world and launch files for testing the the [Multi-Robot Graph SLAM Framework](https://github.com/aserbremen/Multi-Robot-Graph-SLAM) in a simulated environment using Gazebo. Tested on

- ROS2 humble and Gazebo Fortress
- ROS2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic (minimal, see below), checkout branch `gazebo_harmonic`

## Dependencies

This package depends on the following packages:

- [Gazebo Fortress](https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/install)
- [Gazebo Harmonic](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/getstarted/)
- [ros_gz](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/humble)

```
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-gz # ROS2 JazzHumble
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-ros-gz # ROS2 Jazzy
```

## Usage for two robots in the marsyard2020 environment

The demo explained in this section can be checked out in this video on youtube:

### 1. Launch the world 
Launch the world in gazebo with the following command. Note that the first call to gazebo might take a while, since it has to download the models of the fortress.

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim marsyard2020.launch.py
```
### 2. Spawn the robots and start the ros_gz bridge and teleop node
Spawn two robots equipped with LIDAR sensors and bridge the sensor data to ROS2 topics. Also start the teleop_joystick node to control the first robot atlas with a joystick (xbox). This terminal has to be kept active.

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim dual_robot_sim.launch.py # only for Gazebo Fortress at the moment
```

You should be able to control the first robot atlas with the joystick. 

### 3. Control the robots via the terminal
If you don't have a joystick, you can disable the teleop_joystick node in the [dual robot config](config/dual_robot_sim.yaml) by setting `enable_teleop_joy` to false. Then you can control the robot with the keyboard using the following command:

```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r __node:=teleop_twist_keyboard_node_atlas -r /cmd_vel:=/atlas/cmd_vel
```

Second robot bestla can be controlled with the keyboard in a new terminal using the following command:

```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r __node:=teleop_twist_keyboard_node_bestla -r /cmd_vel:=/bestla/cmd_vel
``` 

### 4. Start two instances of the Multi-Robot Graph SLAM Framework
Now to test the Multi-Robot Graph SLAM Framework with the [mrg_slam](https://github.com/aserbremen/mrg_slam) package. Run two instances of the slam algorithm as follows:

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam mrg_slam.launch.py model_namespace:=atlas x:=-15.0 y:=13.5 z:=1.1 # terminal 1
ros2 launch mrg_slam mrg_slam.launch.py model_namespace:=bestla x:=-15.0 y:=-13.0 z:=1.1 # terminal 2
```

Or use two instances of Multi-Robot Graph SLAM inside two docker containers. Make sure that the docker containers can communicate with the host machine. For example, environment variables like ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY or ROS_DOMAIN_ID should not be set or should be correctly set. Then run the following commands:

``` 
docker run -it --rm --network=host --ipc=host --pid=host -e MODEL_NAMESPACE=atlas -e USE_SIM_TIME=true -e X=-15.0 -e Y=13.5 -e Z=1.1 --name atlas_slam mrg_slam # terminal 1
docker run -it --rm --network=host --ipc=host --pid=host -e MODEL_NAMESPACE=bestla -e USE_SIM_TIME=true -e X=-15.0 -e Y=-13.0 -e Z=1.1 --name bestla_slam mrg_slam # terminal 2
```

### 5. Visualize the results in rviz2
Move the robots and visualize the results in rviz2:

```
rviz2 -d /path/to/mrg_slam/rviz/mrg_slam.rviz --ros-args -p use_sime_time:=true
```

## Additional use cases

### Simulate a single robot without a namespace / robot name

Many packages use hard-coded frames like `/base_link` or `/odom`. If you want to test the Multi-Robot Graph SLAM Framework with a single robot without a namespace, you can use the [single_robot_sim.launch.py](launch/single_robot_sim.launch.py) launch file. After launching the gazebo world in step 1 above, you can spawn a single robot. 

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim single_robot_sim.launch.py # Gazebo Fortress & Harmonic
```

### Simulate a single robot with a namespace / robot name

If you want to test the Multi-Robot Graph SLAM Framework with a single robot with a namespace, you need to set the `robot_name` parameter in the [single_robot_marsyard2020_sim.yaml](config/single_robot_marsyard2020_sim.yaml) file. After launching the gazebo world in step 1 above, you can spawn a single robot with a namespace.

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim single_robot_sim.launch.py
```

### Launch the world with any number of robots

Check out the [config/multi_robot_sim.yaml](config/multi_robot_sim.yaml) file to set the robot_names, the initial poses, and the topics to bridge from gazebo to ROS2. Then you can spawn any number of robots and start bridging topics using the following command:

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim multi_robot_sim.launch.py
```

### Launch other worlds
At the moment there are two worlds available: marsyard2020 and rubicon. You can launch the rubicon world with the following command:

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim rubicon.launch.py
```

To spawn two robots at the correct positions in the rubicon world, you can use the following command:

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim dual_robot_sim.launch.py world:=rubicon # dual robot in rubicon world
ros2 launch mrg_slam_sim single_robot_sim.launch.py world:=rubicon # single robot in rubicon world
```

Note that when you start an instance of the Multi-Robot Graph SLAM Framework, you have to set the correct initial position of the robot in the rubicon world. The initial poses can be found in the [config](config) folder.

```
ros2 launch mrg_slam mrg_slam.launch.py model_namespace:=atlas x:=-7.0 y:=0.0 z:=3.96 # terminal 1
ros2 launch mrg_slam mrg_slam.launch.py model_namespace:=bestla x:=0.0 y:=-15.0 z:=3.8 # terminal 2
```
